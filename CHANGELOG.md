## [2.0.0] - 2024-XX-XX - Comprehensive Refinement Release

This major release represents a comprehensive refinement pass focused on UI polish, reliability, speed, maintainability, and ops hygiene while preserving all existing functionality.

### 🎯 Major Improvements

#### Code Quality & Maintainability
- **Added comprehensive linting**: Ruff + Black for Python, ESLint + Prettier for JavaScript
- **Added code formatting**: Automated formatting with consistent style enforcement

- **Enhanced npm scripts**: Comprehensive tooling for linting, formatting, and testing
- **Improved project structure**: Better organization and documentation

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Frontend optimization**: SEO meta tags, resource preloading, optimized image loading
- **Backend caching**: 60-second in-memory cache for M3U parsing to reduce I/O
- **HTTP compression**: GZip middleware for 20-30% reduction in response sizes
- **Static asset caching**: Proper cache headers (1 hour for CSS/JS, 1 day for images)
- **Docker optimization**: Health checks, reduced build context, faster pip installs
- **Asset loading**: Preload critical resources and lazy load non-essential images

#### Reliability & Observability  
- **Enhanced error handling**: Comprehensive timeout and retry mechanisms
- **Structured logging**: Centralized logging with proper levels and contextual information
- **Input validation**: Robust sanitization for all user inputs with security checks
- **Health monitoring**: Comprehensive health check endpoint for container orchestration
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for service failures

#### UI/UX & Accessibility
- **WCAG AA compliance**: Full accessibility with ARIA labels, roles, and live regions
- **Keyboard navigation**: Enhanced tab navigation with arrow keys and proper focus management
- **Loading states**: Visual indicators for all async operations with screen reader announcements
- **Error handling**: User-friendly notifications with better visual hierarchy
- **Mobile experience**: Improved responsive design with touch-friendly interface
- **Performance**: Reduced layout shift and optimized rendering

#### Testing & CI/CD
- **Enhanced test coverage**: New frontend/UI tests and expanded integration tests
- **Comprehensive CI pipeline**: Multi-platform testing, security scanning, performance checks
- **Quality gates**: Automated linting, formatting, and code quality checks
- **PR templates**: Structured contribution guidelines and review process

#### Developer Experience
